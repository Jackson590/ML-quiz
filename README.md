Model Deployment-Gradio_Using API (Flask)

First, I need to outline the project's purpose. The model predicts house prices in Rwanda based on the number of rooms and area. The README should mention that the project includes a dataset, a trained model, and deployment scripts for both Flask and Gradio.

House Price Prediction Model Deployment
========================================

This project demonstrates deploying a machine learning model (linear regression) to predict house prices using two methods: Gradio GUI and Flask API.

---
Prerequisites
-------------
1. Python 3.7+
2. Install required packages:
   pip install gradio flask numpy scikit-learn pandas

---
Deployment Methods
------------------

1. Gradio GUI (User-Friendly Interface)
----------------------------------------
Steps:
1. Run the Gradio app:
   python gradio_app.py
2. A public link will be generated (e.g., "Running on public URL: https://xxx.gradio.app"). Open it in a browser.
3. Input:
   - Select "Number of Rooms" (1-23).
   - Enter "House Area" in square meters.
4. Click "Submit" to see the predicted price.

---

2. Flask API (Web Integration)
------------------------------
Steps:
1. Rename "house_model.pkl" to "model.pkl".
2. Run the Flask app:
   python app.py
3. Access the web interface at http://localhost:5000.
4. Input:
   - Select "Number of Rooms" (1-5 in default UI; edit index.html to extend range).
   - Enter "House Area" in square meters.
5. Click "Predict" to view the result.

---
Usage Instructions
------------------
- Input Features:
  * Number of Rooms: Integer between 1-23 (matches training data).
  * House Area (mÂ²): Float value (e.g., 100, 200.5).

- Output:
  * Predicted price in Rwandan Francs (Rwf), formatted as "Predicted Price: X,XXX.XX Rwf".

---
Notes
-----
1. The model (house_model.pkl) was trained on data with rooms ranging 1-23.
2. For production, disable Flask debug mode (set debug=False in app.py).
