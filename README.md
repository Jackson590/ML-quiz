Model Deployment-Gradio_Using API (Flask)

First, I need to outline the project's purpose. The model predicts house prices in Rwanda based on the number of rooms and area. The README should mention that the project includes a dataset, a trained model, and deployment scripts for both Flask and Gradio.

Next, the user provided four files: the dataset, Flask app, Gradio app, and the model. The README should guide users through setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and running both apps. I should list the necessary packages like Flask, Gradio, scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas. Also, mention creating a virtual environment for better practice.

Including prerequisites is important. Python 3.6+ is a must, and maybe note that pip should be up to date. Users might not be familiar with virtual environments, so adding steps for that would be helpful.

For the directory structure, it's good to show where each file should be placed. The user's files include house_dataset.csv, app.py (Flask), gradio_app.py, house_model.pkl, and index.html. The README should clarify the structure so users can organize their files correctly.

Usage instructions need to be clear. For the Flask app, explain running app.py and accessing via localhost. For Gradio, running gradio_app.py and the local link. Also, mention that the Gradio examples are from the dataset to show real data points.

Finally, a disclaimer that the model is for educational purposes and not professional use covers liability. Making sure the README is comprehensive but not overwhelming is key. Use clear headings, code blocks for commands, and bullet points for readability.
